# address-book

This is a simple C-based **Address Book** application that allows users to manage a contact list through a command-line interface.

Features include:
- Adding new contacts
- Editing existing contacts
- Deleting contacts
- Loading and saving contact lists from a `.csv` file
- Sorting contacts alphabetically
- Quitting and saving changes safely

This project was designed as a small demonstration of file handling, data structures (linked lists), and user interaction in C.
